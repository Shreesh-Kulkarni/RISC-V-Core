# 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Processor(RV32I)
A repository consisting of all the project files and codes for RISC-V Processor design using Transaction Level Verilog.

This repository is for the MYTH(Microprocessors in Thirty Hours) by Redwood EDA and TheEEView.

The final RV32I core in TLV format can be viewed in the RV32Icore.tlv file.

The System verilog file for the same is also uploaded for reference. The TLV file is converted to the SV file using Sandpiper SaaS compiler in Makerchip IDE.

### If you want to view my project, you can visit the public sandbox link for the makerchip platform below.

For Viz option, make sure you specify the final pipeline stage for your cpu.

### Important : It's advised to silence all the warnings for unassigned signals to prevent any Viz errors. You can observe this in the code- `BOGUS_USE(//YOUR SIGNALS HERE)`
